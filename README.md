## Aim ##
The aim of this project is to allow us to create our own website by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. This project is a website about introducing about myself, showcase
some of my skills and past project.

## UX ##

This project I started with a mobile first design approach as it is much easier compare to desktop first approach. I started creating mockups wireframe on paper for mobile only. I then slowly move 
into creating mockups and wireframes for medium and larger screens. The design of the site is fully design by myself, showcasing smooth layout and interactive for most devices.


Milstones had to be set in order to finish this project
Below are steps by steps on the journey of clear goals that required to be achieved for this website.
1. I want to create a portfolio of myself to showcase people of other side project I had done.
2. I started layout the skeleton of the website, which resaults in 4 different sections (Index, about, portfolio, contact).
3. I want to be able to use this website in various size screens. (small, medium and large)
4. I want to allow people to contact more information to me via contact section.
5. I want all my pictures to be interactive and not out of place.
6. I want to introduce my 3D print project to other so I can reach out more people with the same interest.
7. I want people to be able to download my resume as I am keen to explore new field and experience.
8. I want to keep this website up to date.


The navigation bar is responsive having different layout in large screens, medium and smaller screens. The navigation links will disappear on screen width which is below 992 pixels and it will 
form a hamburger icon menu on the top right of the website. When the hamburer icon is being clicked, a dropdown list with navigation links will displayed. The [Index page](https://yishenglee.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html)
is to display summarise information about myself. The picture in the background is a picture got on the internet and I use photoshop software to edit the color and blur the image to allow the text
to be clearly shown. The [About page](https://yishenglee.github.io/milestone-project-1/about.html) is to allow people to know what serives I am able to provide them or have any opportunies 
to work with them in a project. An email button is also put in place to contact me for more information. 

The [Portfolio page](https://yishenglee.github.io/milestone-project-1/portfolio.html) is to showcase some of other talents such as Product Design and 3D printing technology. This link also will display
some project I had done in the past during my free time. The [Contact page](https://yishenglee.github.io/milestone-project-1/contact.html) is to give the user to contact me and describe their 
required services from me or vise versa. This page is also allow me to get more information about the interested party, so I can provide the best services to all my client. The dropdown list for the 
selection of countries allowed me to learn more about the ISO standard for coding in HTML.


During the whole process of designing this website, finding images and icons that visualy went together is kind of challengin and time consuming.
